# URL Shortener Microservice

My solution for the [URL Shortener Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/url-shortener-microservice)
 project from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

Check the code in action: ["Live Demo" on Replit](https://boilerplate-project-urlshortener.panagiotispapa3.repl.co)

(Disclaimer: it is not really super useful as shortener, with such a long host name though ðŸ™‚)

Backend:
* Nodejs
* Express (for the HTTP Server)
